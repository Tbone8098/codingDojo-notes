# INTRODUCTION
- alumni
- career switcher
    - teacher to coder to teacher

# SLIDE 7
## Learn by doing
- Immersive Environment -> sets appart from other
    - Learn by doing
        - ie: playing piano won't happen by watching youtube
        - you will be coding the entire time
    - flipped learning style / flipped classroom
- 24/7 Platform Access
    - lots of bootcamps don't have
    - accessable 24/7
- 3 Full-Stack Curriculum
    - be a proficiant dev in all 3 stacks
- Daily Algorithms
    - do algos everyday
    - important part that helps you THINK like a develeper
    - practice and prepare for the job interview

## Workshop
- Project-Based Assignments
    - all assigments are project base
    - building whole websites
- Pair Programming
    - paired up with other
    - simulates on the job scenareos
- Code Review
    - Instructors and TA will look at the code and give advice on how to improve the code
    - give our "pro-tips"
- Project Presentations
    - every stack dedicate 1 week for projects
    - one day to present -> more on the job practice
    - build up that resume 

## Indrustry
- Tech Talks (Online)
    - on Zoom -> learn more about the indrustry
- Hackathons
    - work together -> short time limit -> accomplish a goal
- Career Workshops
    - getting out there
    - expose to the indrustry
    - guidlines and experences
- Industry Exposure

## Community
- Meetups & Events
    - done online
- Activity Day (Onsite only)
    - Jack box party games
- Expand Your Network
    - being and doing life at the dojo with other cohort mates

# SLIDE 9
## Zoom
- Screen share on
- one of the instructors (Devan)
    - talking about singly linked list 
- anotate tools with zoom
    - powerful
    - presentor AND other students
## Discord
- primary means of communication
- talking with cohorts
- asking for help

# SLIDE 10
## Learn Platform
- in house / independant
- many others don't have an active platform in which you can pull the learning content
    - went to another bootcamp at UW and they used a git repo to give learning content 
- access 24/7
- post grad: alumni pass 

# SLIDE 12
## What is FULL Stack?
- teaching WEB DEVELOPMENT
- 3 Parts
    - Front End (client)
        - This is what the end user will see on their computer. 
        - deals with the browser (ie: chrome, firefox, edge)
        - Languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
    - Backend
        - This is all the logic that will happen on the server computer. 
        - Amazon AWS, Heroku, 
        - Languages: Python stack, JavaScript (MERN), C#, Java
    - Database
        - This is where the actual information is stored
        - When you create an account on a website your profile info is stored on the database. 

- The server is a middle man -> between frontend and database 
- after learning all three -> FULL STACK DEV

- companies want full stack developers because it give them full controll!

# SLIDE 13
## 3 full stacks
- offers 3 full stacks (location dependant)
- lots of technologies involved with each stack -> When your done it looks good 
- most bootcamps only offer 1
    - gives a wide understanding of what is out there
    - Not focused on 1 skill/technology -> tech changes fast. 
    - focued on the basics and the ability to learn new tech. 
- Learn everything you need to work for those big companies


# SLIDE 14
## Possible Timeline
- Programming Basics - for those people coming in with 0 experience
    - test out of this
    - working with your computer and working with coding
- start with webfund
    - learn the basics of the front end -> HTML, CSS, JS
    - 2 weeks
- Python
    - 4 weeks
    - everybody starts with python first
    - good language to start with
        - reads like english
        - has a wide scope of what it can do
- MERN


# SLIDE 15
## Standard Day
- algos at 9
    - important
    - fluences of the fundaments
    - interview skill
    - THINKING like a programmer - solving problems
- morning session
    - concepts for the day
    - framework or database
- open coding lab
    - working on assignments
    - doing code reviews
    - breakout rooms
    - afternoon session
    - fingers on the keys
- prepare for the next day
    - do the reading
- lots of time commitment
    - that is how we get this done in 14 weeks
# SLIDE 16
## Can I actually do it?
- yes!!
- about the learning science behind our approach

# SLIDE 17
- gather data and learn parts in order to solve whatever problem comes at us. 
- sample one
- sample two 
- simularities between the two samples
    - mi and my
    - name and nombre
- with three samples we add
    - mio
    - nome
- when we see the answer we can see the simularities between the samples

# SLIDE 18
- By learning more languages it makes it easier to learn more languages
- like a snowball effect.
- by the time we get to the end we have picked up speed
- IMPORTANT: we are teaching -> how to learn
    - tech is changing


# SLIDE 19
