# Agile

## (slide 2) Why are projects so important?
1. one thing to say that you learned these skills and another to have proof.... `the proof is in the pudding` as they say
2. They are going to look at your work!

## (slide 3) Goals
1. create a MVP
2. prepare yourself to speak in front of people
    1. better to speak infront of your fellow students first than to speak for the first time infront of your potential boss.

## (slide __ ) Waterfall VS Agile
 1.  waterfall = discover -> plan -> build -> review
     1.  only deploy when project is complete 
     2.  start and finish
 2.  Agile
     1.  take start and finish and apply to different features in your project. 
     2.  __PROS__ `ask the class`
         1.  pivot from origional plans
         2.  deploy sooner

## () User Stories
1. always thinking about the user
   1. AS A _role_
   2. I WANT _goal_
   3. SO THAT _benefit_
2. Descussion questions -> on the side
