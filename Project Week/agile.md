# Agile

## (slide 2) Why are projects so important?
1. one thing to say that you learned these skills and another to have proof.... `the proof is in the pudding` as they say
2. They are going to look at your work!

## (slide 3) Goals
1. create a MVP
2. prepare yourself to speak in front of people
    1. better to speak infront of your fellow students first than to speak for the first time infront of your potential boss.

## (slide 4) The Agile Development Process
1. Plan -> Design -> Develop -> test -> release -> feeback -> back to the begining
2. broken down into sprints
3. Created about 20 years ago
4. creates space for iterative feedback and continuous improvement 

## (slide 5 ) Waterfall VS Agile
 1.  waterfall = discover -> plan -> build -> review
     1.  only deploy when project is complete 
     2.  start and finish
 2.  Agile
     1.  take start and finish and apply to different features in your project. 
     2.  __PROS__ `ask the class`
         1.  pivot from origional plans
         2.  deploy sooner

## (slide 6) User Stories
1. always thinking about the user
   1. AS A _role_
   2. I WANT _goal_
   3. SO THAT _benefit_
2. Descussion questions -> on the side

## (slide 7) Example Ebay slide
1. class participation -> class creates user stories
   1. potential breakout rooms
   2. find a popular website and break it down

## (slide 8) A platform to keep track -> Trello Boards
1. columns
   1. to do
   2. doing
   3. done

## (slide 9) Activities
1. setup trello board
2. give you a list of task 
3. you need to prioritize them 1st, 2nd, 3rd ...etc
4. no right answer
   ```
    As a registered user, I want to save items I would like to purchase in a cart so I can check out all at once.

    2nd - As a website visitor, I want to be able to click a button and add my credit card information so I can buy an item online.

    As a registered user, I want to be able to register for emails so I can receive shipping updates.

    As a website visitor, I want to create an account as a registered user so I can save my information.

    As a website visitor, I want to be able to read reviews for products so I can assess their quality before I buy.

    As a website visitor, I want to be able to review products so I can share my experience with other users.

    1st - As a website visitor, I want to be able to view products categorized into groups so I can browse efficiently. 
    ```
5. __Ask the class__ `What do we do when we get into the breakout room?`
    1. setup trello account
    2. prioritize user stories

## (slide 10) Designing you MVP 
1. Small steps
1. build one step at a time, deploy, and go again

## Examples
1. MVP -> core of the app
1. pickout some of the features and have the class build user stories for the features
1. required to submit of a wireframe

## (slide 15) Individual VS Group Work
1. For python we are going to push for the individual work. 
2. there are beneifits to doing both, group and individual. 
3. get it out of the way, __important__ for imployeers to see that you have something that is YOURS alone. 
4. in other stacks you will be able to work on group assigments. 
5. If you have only worked in groups then you have only done part of all your projects

## (slide 16) Meeting schedule 
1. planning meeting - MVP -> begining of a sprint
    1. present your....
        - MVP
        - Wireframe
        - trello board -> user stories
        - timeline
2. Daily standups
    - Asigned groups
    - (CA) Coders Anonimous -> support group.
